Password Generator Project

This project challenged my understanding of sequential prompts and nested values through variables and functions. 
One of my first attempts at using Javascript to implement logic throughout a webpage. While it is a basic design, the compolexity came through familiarizing myself with computer thought process and properly pseudocoding the necessary order of operations. 
With over fifteen hours logged on this webpage, there is still much to enhance and apply. I look forward to making it more sophisticated as the weeks go on.
