          <!-- Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes. -->

       <!-- ## User Story -->

       <!-- ``` -->
       <!-- AS AN employee with access to sensitive data -->
       <!-- I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria -->
       <!-- SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security -->
       <!-- ``` -->

       <!-- ## Acceptance Criteria -->


       <!-- GIVEN I need a new, secure password -->


          <!-- WHEN I click the button to generate a password -->
       <!-- THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria -->
                    
          <!-- WHEN prompted for password criteria -->
       <!-- THEN I select which criteria to include in the password -->
       <!-- WHEN prompted for the length of the password -->
       <!-- THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters -->

       <!-- WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password -->
       <!-- THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters -->

       <!-- WHEN I answer each prompt -->
       <!-- THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected -->
          <!-- WHEN all prompts are answered -->
       <!-- THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria -->
       <!-- WHEN the password is generated -->
       <!-- THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page -->
       <!-- ``` -->
